# Hatsune Miku Project DIVA Arcade Future Tone on Steam Deck

Do you want to run Project DIVA Arcade on your Steam Deck?

Are you completely lost on how to get it working?

Have you been stuck on errors for weeks? ~~maybe that was just me~~

Well, here's a guide on the method I used to get the version of the game working on my Steam Deck.

## Need more help?

You can join the [Project DIVA Modding 2nd](https://discord.gg/cvBVGDZ) Discord Server , the people there helped a lot trying to get this thing working for me and I'd probably still be stuck without them.

You can also join the [Steam Deck](https://discord.gg/SteamDeck) Discord Server for general advice on Linux and Steam Deck things, but keep in mind this guide won't really go in depth on anything beyond getting Project DIVA working.

Make sure to check the [PD Loader Wiki](https://github.com/PDModdingCommunity/PD-Loader/wiki/2\)-Installation) for more in depth info on the Launcher and more too.
